Terraform's `.tfvars` files are used to manage AWS environments. While variables are defined in the `.tf` files, their inputs are provided in the `.tfvars` variable definitions file that uses the same basic syntax as Terraform language files but consists only of variable name assignments and comments.

To configure your cluster with proper parameters before deployment, set variables for your project in the [`example.tfvars`](https://github.com/provectus/swiss-army-kube/blob/master/example/example.tfvars) file. It contains variables for all modules in one place, making it easy to set up your configuration quickly and without having to work across multiple separate files for each module.

## Variables of Worker Nodes (EC2 Instances)
 
Use this block of variables to set up the type, number, and other parameters of your EC2 instances for the following node types:

1. Common - On-Demand EC2 instances
2. CPU - CPU-focused EC2 instances 
3. GPU - GPU-focused EC2 instances


**On-Demand (Common) Instances**

With On-Demand instances, you pay for instances that you launch per hour or second, on a fixed-price basis. 
Unlike Spots, on-demand instances are stable and won't disappear out of the blue. 
We recommend, that at least 30% of your cluster consist of on-demand instances as the best practice. 

* [On-Demand Instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-on-demand-instances.html)
* [Amazon EC2 On-Demand Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand/)

**Spot Instances** 

Spot instances are a spare capacity that AWS sells at up to 90% discount. Using them allows you to save money by optimizing workload costs. The downside is that Spots are not guaranteed to stay available and can be recalled by AWS at any time. The more spots you use in an EKS cluster, the more risk exists for your cluster to suddenly become unavailable.  

If you want use spot instance, set on_demand_common_percentage_above_base_capacity in percent. When set 30%, it's means that 70% instance in ASG common will be spot instance.

**CPU Instances**

Amazon EC2 C instances with high-performance processors. CPU instances are critical for resource-intensive tasks like scientific modeling, machine learning inference, and other compute-intensive apps.  

* [Amazon EC2 Compute Optimized Instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/#Compute_Optimized)
 
**GPU Instances** 

Amazon EC2 P instances with high-performance processors. GPU instances use hardware accelerators, or co-processors, to perform functions more efficiently than is possible in software running on CPUs. GPUs are often used by data scientists to calculate ML models, perform functions, process graphics, etc. 

* [Amazon EC2 Accelerated Computing Instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/#Compute_Optimized)

All nodes of a cluster are labeled with node type (Common, GPU, CPU). When you deploy an app, you can use Kubernetes tools to specify which group of nodes to deploy this particular app to.

* [Check all Amazon EC2 Instance Types.](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/)

### Variables of On-Demand EC2 Instances
|Name               	|Description                    |Default / Example
|-----------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------
|`on_demand_common_max_cluster_size` | Maximum number of nodes in a cluster |`5`
|`on_demand_common_min_cluster_size ` 	| Minimum number of nodes in a cluster |`1`
|`on_demand_common_desired_capacity` 	| How many nodes will get started |`2`
|`on_demand_common_instance_type`   	| Amazon EC2 instance types in order of priority|`"m5.large", "m5.xlarge", "m5.2xlarge"`
|`on_demand_common_allocation_strategy`  | Allocation strategy that will define priority and number of different on-demand EC2 instance types in your cluster. Valid values: `prioritized`. |`prioritized`
|`on_demand_common_base_capacity`        | Percent of EC2 instances of this type in a cluster. Controls how much of the initial cluster capacity is made up of Common on-demand EC2 instances. Set to 0 indicates that you prefer to launch them as a percentage of the total group capacity that is running at any given time.    |`0`
|`on_demand_common_percentage_above_base_capacity `  | Controls the percentage of the add-on to the initial group that is made up of on-demand EC2 Instances versus the percentage that is made up of Spot Instances.|`100`
|`on_demand_common_asg_recreate_on_change`        	| When true, recreates an ASG group if changes have been made. |`true`

## Using GPU Instances 

NVIDIA GPUs can now be consumed via container level resource requirements using the resource name `nvidia.com/gpu`:
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: gpu-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: cuda-container
      image: nvidia/cuda:9.0-devel
      resources:
        limits:
          nvidia.com/gpu: 2 # requesting 2 GPUs
    - name: digits-container
      image: nvidia/digits:6.0
      resources:
        limits:
          nvidia.com/gpu: 2 # requesting 2 GPUs
```
WARNING: 

If you don't request GPUs when using the device plugin with NVIDIA images, all the GPUs on the machine will be exposed inside your container.
